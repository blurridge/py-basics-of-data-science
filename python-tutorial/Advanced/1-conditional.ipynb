    "# **Conditional Statements in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like every other programming language, Python also has some predefined conditional statements. A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know:\n",
    "1. `if statement`\n",
    "2. `if-else statement`\n",
    "3. `if-elif-else ladder`"
